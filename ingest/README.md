# Ingest Tool
This module is the ingest tool for Dominion Data. It pulls data from publically-available APIs related to Dominion Sets (i.e expansions) and serializes the information for local storage. 

Card data is stored in dominion_data/pickle/all_cards.pkl

## Using the Ingest Tool
run the following from the root of the project: ```python3 -m ingest.ingest_tool```
